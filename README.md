# python_translator
Just a side project of creating a translator - I mean who wouldn't want another google translate?

## Getting Started
This project is actually intended just so I can practice Chinese (Mandarin) and perhaps learn other languages along the way. Since
languages are evolutionary, I will continue to update and make changes to this project. In the end, I would like it to
be able to translate a text, very precisely, to another language (just a long term goal set for myself). I plan on
building everything from scratch - starting with just a list of words.
